# Machine-Learning
  
Welcome! I enjoy explaining concepts, and this repository is for everyone looking to learn machine learningâ€”from basics to advanced topics.

Each Jupyter Notebook contains detailed explanations of machine learning concepts. Since this is a new repository, it will take time to gather resources and cover all topics. I update it whenever possible, adding new concepts and insights.

This repository is also a great resource for interview preparation, as I compile knowledge from various sources like YouTube videos, Medium blogs, and other references. You'll find links to the original sources for further reading.
